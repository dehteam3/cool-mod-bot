# cool-mod-bot

This is a project made by me for discord bots
Made with Javascript
Used discord.js package

### Steps
1. Change some things in `config.json` file
```js
{
  "token": "TOKEN-HERE",
  "prefix": "PREFIX-HERE",
  "mongo": "MONGOOSE-CONNECTION-STRING-HERE"
}
```
2. Run the bot with `node bot.js`
